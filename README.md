# Innocosm Project
<hr>
### Innocosm.org is an Open Source project to build Django web based application. 

### Project time line is targeting spring 2022 or earlier to release the Alpha application and source on the web.<br>

### Our Mission:
Creating an ecosystem for invention using a knowledge base containing the seeds of the inventive insight used in creating something new, derived, and/or issued to resolve issues to overcome

#### Our goals:
Creating an Open Source Community Web application that will use an enhanced version of the 'Theory of inventive problem solving', originally developed by [Ideation International.](http://www.whereinnovationbegins.net/) Using these techniques and methods can help achieve your goals using a time tested knowledge based system derived from millions of patents since 1947 onward to assist in the creation incremental innovations, new professional innovations and discovery of new paradigms.

#### Our gratitude goes out to those that made all this possible:
 [Ideation International](http://www.whereinnovationbegins.net/)  working in collaboration with Dr. Ron Fulbright, Creator of the 'Systematic Innovation' INFO307 course at the University of South Carolina Upstate branch and Dr. Fulbright's book ["Knowlege-Based Innovation: Ideation with I-TRIZ Operators"](https://rfulbright.wixsite.com/ronfulbright/projects)
